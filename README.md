_Graphical Languages for Creating Infographics_

Summary (from [ANR project page](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE33-0002)):

> Visualizations are commonly used to summarize complex data, illustrate problems and solutions, tell stories over data, or shape public attitudes. Unfortunately, dominant visualization systems largely target scientists and data-analysis tasks and thus fail to support communication purposes. This project looks at visualization design practices. It investigates tools and techniques that can help graphic designers, illustrators, data journalists, and infographic artists, produce creative and effective visualizations for communication. The project aims to address the more ambitious goal of computer-aided design tools, where visualization creation is driven by the graphics, starting from sketches, moving to flexible graphical structures that embed constraints, and ending to data and generative parametric instructions, which can then re-feed the designer’s sketches and graphics. The partners bring expertise from Human-Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, and Computer Graphics.
